                                                        <strong>Red Cells</strong> - these give your blood its red color and carry oxygen to your organs and tissues.
                                                        <br>
                                                        <strong>Platelets</strong> - the very small colorless cell fragments in your blood whose main function is to stop bleeding.
                                                        <br>
                                                        <strong>Plasma</strong> - the liquid portion of your blood that transports water and nutrients to your body's tissues.

                                                 <p>You can donate whole blood every 56 days. Red blood cells will return to normal levels within approximately two weeks of donation.
                                                   <br>
                                                    You can donate platelets (apheresis donation) as much as twice in a 7- day period - or up to 24 times in a rolling 12 months. Platelet and plasma components are replaced in the body more quickly than red cells. Platelets will return to normal levels within a few hours of donating.
                                                     Plasma, the liquid portion of your blood, takes a couple of days.</p>

                                         <p>Double red cell donations are performed using an apheresis machine, where the actual donation takes about 30-35 minutes,
                                              and allow you to donate two pints of red cells.</p>

                                           screening, laboratory testing, and donor record checks are in place at donor centers to help ensure the safety of blood transfusions.</p>

             <p class="paragraph"> A single donation can save three lives. One blood donation provides different blood 
                 components that can help up to three different people.
                  Blood cannot be manufactured. Despite medical and technological advances,
                   blood cannot be made, so donations are the only way we can give blood to
                    those who need it. Blood is needed every two seconds.
                  Nearly 21 million blood components are transfused in the U.S. every year. </p>
